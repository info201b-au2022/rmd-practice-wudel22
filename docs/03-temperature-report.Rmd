### About R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

# Summary Information

## The Chart

This a report on temperatures. Specifically, it presents a distribution of *subjective* **feelings** for different temperatures. (Note: This is markdown. However, we can put in a chunk or R code, and it will show us the code and results! The [R Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) is useful!)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
get_chart()
avg_temp <- get_avg_temperature()
max_temp <- get_max_temperature()
min_temp <- get_min_temperature()
box_plot <- get_box_plot()
```

## The Average, Min, and Max Temperatures

-   The average temperature is: **`r avg_temp` Celsius**.
-   The maximum temperature is: **`r max_temp` Celsius**.
-   The minimum temperature is: **`r min_temp` Celsius**.

##Show the Distribution of Temperatures in a Box Plot
```{r, echo=TRUE}
box_plot
```

## The Dataset

Let's show the dataset. Although this is not very nice to look it, it might be helpful for debugging. The key point: We can intermix R and markdown to create reports.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(get_temperature_data())
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
